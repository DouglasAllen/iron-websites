Why Iron{{language}}?
---------------------
Iron{{language}} is an excellent addition to the .NET Framework, providing {{language}}
developers with the power of the .NET framework. Existing .NET developers can
also use Iron{{language}} as a fast and expressive scripting language for embedding,
testing, or writing a new application from scratch.

The CLR is a great platform for creating programming languages, and the DLR
makes it all the better for dynamic languages. Also, the .NET framework
(base class library, presentation foundation, Silverlight, etc.) gives
developers an amazing amount of functionality and power.
